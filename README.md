# Hello!
I'm spir0th, a Filipino student who likes to code during freetime.

Developing software is my thing during freetime, I also produce (bad) music, play video games, taking pictures,
and some Linux enthusiasm. I started my programming/tech journey since 2020 and I still adore it even though I am
busy most of the time.

If you would like to know about me, just visit [my portfolio!](https://spir0th.github.io)
