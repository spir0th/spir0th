# Hi!
I'm Gian Borcillo, also known as spir0th.

Developing software is my thing, I also produce (bad) music, and I have a habit of editing videos with my sterile ideas.

My first experiences of programming were [PyDroid 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) and [Sketchware](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.besome.sketch) at the age of 11. To know more about how I started my programming journey, I'll make a blog about it soon!

About my age and where I live, I can only say that I'm now 16 and I live in the Philippines.
